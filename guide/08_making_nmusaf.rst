====================
08 Making the NMUSAF 
====================

With a game like SensorCraft you can build almost anything: your house, your
school, or your favorite place.  For this exercise we are going to build our
favorite place, the `National Museum of the United States Air Force
<http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Home.aspx>`_ (NMUSAF). The NMUSAF is the
largest and oldest military aviation museum in the world, located at Wright
Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.  Where else can you see a Wright 
Flyer then see a B2 Stealth Bomber?  If you ever get a chance to visit Dayton, 
go see the NMUSAF. Check out the code for exercise 8  ``08_making_nmusaf.py``. 
A number of changes have been made to make this work.  We added new textures in
the file ``nmusaf_textures.png`` and created keys to load and save the entire 
world.  To load the world, press the ``L`` key and press the ``O`` key to save 
the world.  We used `Google Maps <https://www.google.com/maps/place/National+Museum+of+the+US+A
ir+Force/@39.7807961,-84.1115705,1019m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8840832fc83
ffd85:0x71e29a127c5a32c9!8m2!3d39.7807961!4d-84.1093818>`_  to get a aerial view
of the NMUSAF which helped us make the world to scale.
